RBAC (Role-Based Access Control) in Azure with Entra ID
Azure RBAC (Role-Based Access Control) allows you to control access to resources by assigning roles to users, groups, or service principals in Microsoft Entra ID (formerly Azure AD).

How it Works
1Ô∏è‚É£ A user logs in with Entra ID credentials.
2Ô∏è‚É£ RBAC evaluates their assigned roles at different levels:

Subscription Level (Access to all resources in the subscription).
Resource Group Level (Access to resources inside a specific resource group).
Resource Level (Access to an individual resource, like a VM or Storage Account).
3Ô∏è‚É£ Permissions are based on role definitions:
Example roles:
Reader: Can only view resources.
Contributor: Can manage resources but not assign roles.
Owner: Full control, including assigning roles.
4Ô∏è‚É£ RBAC Assignments are made via IAM (Access Control) in the Azure Portal, CLI, or PowerShell.
üîπ Example: If a Reader role is assigned to a user at the Resource Group level, they can view all resources inside it but cannot make changes.
