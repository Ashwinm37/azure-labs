# Azure Tagging Policy Project

## Goal-
Enforce department-level tagging on all Azure resources using Azure Policy. This ensures every resource includes a `Department` tag to support governance, cost tracking, and automation.

## What It Does-
- Blocks resource creation without the required `Department` tag.
- Helps enforce tagging standards across all teams.
- Improves cost attribution and chargeback processes.

## Files Included-
- `tagging-policy.json`: Policy definition
- `policy-assignment-steps.md`: Step-by-step deployment guide
- `impact-summary.md`: Real-world value and business case
- `screenshots/`: Visual proof of policy assignment and results

## Skills Demonstrated-
- Azure Policy Definition
- Policy Assignment & Scope
- Governance and Compliance
